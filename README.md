# Adaptive-evolution-in-late-development-and-adult
Adaptive evolution of animal proteins expressed in late development and adult
1. We use selection_analysis.R to perform Modularity analysis, Transcriptome index analysis  
and Polygenic selection analysis.
2. We use module_detection.R to detect modules (different sets of specifically expressed genes (modules) in each developmental period).
3. Please see https://github.com/CMPG/polysel for detecting positive selection on pathways.
